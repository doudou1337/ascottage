## Restaurants

*We used to live in downtown Angers for four years, we tried a lot of restaurants and bars, we'd love to share with you our favorite places. Please do remember that you always need to book as early as possible.*

### Angers Restaurants (20 minutes by car)

#### Bistrot des Ducs

After trying many restaurants in big cities around the world, "Des Duc" is always my favorite French bistro, for the good quality, professional service and reasonable price.

#### KAZUMI

Not many Japanese restaurants in Angers, this is the best. Only 12 seats, and 1 chef. Daily menu is decided by the chef, Japanese teppanyaki with French touch.

#### La Cantina Caf√©

Cute little bistro, always full. Classic bistro food, good price. Great for a cozy easy night or a tasty lunch break.

#### Affam√©s

French bistro with a little modern touch, located in a cute Parisian style square near the railway station. One of our favorite lunch places.

#### Autour d'un Cep

Traditional French food, tasty and generous, no fancy deco, just a place for food and wine. Good choice for dinner.

#### Cr√™perie Marie mil'goules

There are many cr√™peries in this area, this is our favorite. Located in a little lane opposite the Castle. Cute deco, no fuss classic menu, nice cider, lots of butter, great value.

#### Restaurant Sens

Great venue, fine dining, we believe they are aiming for the second Michelin star in Angers. Better try before they get the star and raise the price, and book early.

#### LAIT THYM SEL

Fine dining with one Michelin star, we liked it since they started, creative food always, but can be a bit over-priced now. If you are looking for something special, book early.
**Price:** ‚Ç¨100+, book as early as possible!

### Loire-Authion Restaurants

#### La Bafouille (30 minutes by car)

You cannot find better view than this. Just enjoy a glass of ros√© and the best screenshot of Loire in front of you. Even to park in this little town 'La Pointe' is fun and beautiful.

#### La Route du Sel (20 minutes by car)

A must go place especially for summer. Stunning view of Loire, friendly environment. No over the top menu, I would recommend to order a nice bottle of wine and a simple plate, just a relaxing night next to Loire.

#### Les Douceurs du Pilessis (10 minutes by car)

A typical neighborhood restaurant owned by a French couple. Good for the value of lunch set, and the husband will try to speak English which is cute, and good for a tourist in the French countryside.

#### Bellus Fortis (15 minutes by car)

Another neighborhood restaurant, if you don't want to cook in our little kitchen, it's not too bad choice for a little bite, like a typical French countryside bistro.

Paris has 'Bon March√©', we got this classic gourmet shop in Angers. Great local products, much better price.

### Biltoki (Angers, 20 minutes by car)
